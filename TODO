- We should allow for Content Identifier Descriptors to include more than one CRID, as allowed in ETSI 102 323. Freeview has each CRID in a separate descriptor.

- The Authority portion of the CRID is always taken from the SDT. ETSI 102 323 provides several other locations for this information which should be searched before the SDT.

- ETSI 102 323 allows CRID data to be referenced indirectly via a Content Identifier Table (though this use is deprecated). Indirection is not supported as Freeview does not broadcast CITs.
